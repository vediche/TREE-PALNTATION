               These trees may be planted in urban parks (Oldfield et al., 2013), street tree systems (Mullaney et al., 2015), 
			   or on privately-owned land (Nguyen et al., 2017). While the urban forest is often described as the collective 
			   contribution of trees on both publicly accessible lands such as parks and street trees, as well as, private 
			   trees in residential yards (Konijnendijk et al., 2006), a particular focus had been placed on understanding 
			   tree planting and management on public lands (Pauleit et al., 2002; Barker and Kenney, 2012; Roy, 2017). 
			   Tree planting on public lands is typically implemented by municipalities â€“ often in collaboration with non-profit 
			   partners (Young and McPherson, 2013). These tree professionals are recognized as key actors in urban forest management
			   (Roman et al., 2018) and municipal and non-profit records have been used to help understand organizational trends in urban forestry. 
			   For example, Garrison (2017) used planting records for New York City, NY, United States of America (USA) to highlight inequities in the 
			   number of trees planted and socio-economic status by census block. Khan and Conway (2020) used commonly planted tree species in Mississauga,
			   Ontario, Canada to illuminate vulnerabilities in planting palettes to climate change. In a multi-city study throughout Europe, Pauleit et al. 
			   (2002) outlined preferred tree planting techniques and procedures. 
			   There is also a growing body of research that uses surveys to understand municipal (Roy, 2017; Roy et al., 2017) and 
			   non-profit (Conway and Vander Vecht, 2015) motivations in the species selection process. 
			   These organizations voice a preference for native tree species and an emphasis on establishing 
			   planting palettes that will help diversify species composition.

            As urban land cover increases around the world (Seto et al., 2012), 
			trees within the urban matrix serve an increasingly vital role in the provision
			of economic and ecological benefits. These include ecosystem services such as 
			reductions in storm water run-off (Dwyer et al., 1992) and air pollution (Nowak et al., 2006), 
			as well as, reductions in energy (Loughner et al., 2012) and health care costs (Roy et al., 2012). 
		In an effort to bolster these benefits, large- and small-scale tree planting initiatives have emerged as a
		way of increasing urban tree cover in cities throughout North America (Pincetl et al., 2013; Young and McPherson, 2013), 
		Europe (Attwell, 2000; Nielsen and Jensen, 2007), Australia (Roy et al., 2017; Roy, 2017), and Asia (Yang et al., 2005).

			<li>   Cities around the world are pursuing tree planting as a way to increase tree cover.
			Despite the growing interest in planting trees as a way to offset climate change, counter the negative impacts 
			of urbanization, and provide benefits to city dwellers, there has not been a recent effort to quantify the number 
		of trees being planted nor the species composition of these plantings. Because ecosystem services and ecosystem threats
		can transcend municipal boundaries, understanding trends in tree planting at multiple spatial scales is critical. 
		To overcome this knowledge gap, we used a survey to collate recent tree planting data from 52 cities with populations 
		greater than 50,000 people in the Northeastern USA. The four largest cities in our study (New York, Boston,
		Philadelphia, Washington D.C.) planted over 87% of all the trees that were planted in the region. Smaller cities, 
		which are numerous in region, planted proportionally fewer trees and, in over 40% of the small cities surveyed,
		planting palettes included invasive tree species, highlighting both a resource and a knowledge gap in smaller cities 
		as compared with larger ones. Regardless of city size, records also illuminated an overreliance on certain genera for 
		specific ecosystem services; nearly 20% of all shade trees were Quercus species and over 50% of ornamental trees were 
		either Syringa or Prunus species. As cities continue to rely on tree-planting as a form of green infrastructure, our 
		results demonstrate that more consideration to establishing diverse planting palettes will be an important way to 
		ensure that ecological resilience is maintained. Achieving this will depend on increased opportunities to collaborate 
		across municipal boundaries and promoting cross-learning from the experiences of more innovative urbanized regions to 
		urban regions with less infrastructure and expertise.  </li>

           <li>  Plant more trees and as you plant trees you are planting life too because of the fact that
			they are giving us fresh air, woods that we people used to build our houses. ... 
			Trees are natural air filters - taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. 
			Trees protect sources of drinking water by preventing soil erosion.</li>
